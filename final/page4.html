            <h1>The Jump</h1>
            <p>You attempt to jump over the hole. You take a running start and muster all your strength, eyes fixed on the ledge across the gap. Time seems to slow down as your feet leave the ground.</p>
            <p>For a moment, it feels like you might make it. But then, your fingers graze the edge, just short. As you fall you think, "if only I took the other path".</p>
            <p>Suddenly, you're engulfed in heat and you descend into a pool of molten lava. </p>
            <p>There is no escape this time.</p>
