        <h1>The Monster</h1>
        <p>You start walking down the path, and in the distance, you see the shadow of a monstrous figure lurking in the darkness.</p>        
        <p>Your heart pounds and you freeze as the monster shifts slighty. He is unaware of your presence, for now.</p>
        <p>You quickly move behind the closest rock to prevent it from seing you. Your thoughts race as you think of your options, you could try to fight it, hoping to catch it by surprise. Maybe the element of surprise will give you the edge you need. Or you could move silently along the wall, and attempt to stay in the shadows.</p>
        <p>One wrong move, and it will all end here.</p>
        
        <p>What will you do?</p>
