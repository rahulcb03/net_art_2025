    <h1>Attempt to Sneak Past</h1>
    <p>You take a deep breath and carefully step forward, making sure to keep your footsteps light.</p>
    <p>The monster stirs slightly, but you freeze, waiting until it settles again.</p>
    <p>You're almost past it when the monster swiftly turns around and grabs you in his hands. </p>
    <p class="failed"> You failed.</p>
