            <h1>Attack</h1>
            <p>Hurry use the rock and attack!</p>
            <p>Clicking on the rock will allow you to grab it. The monster is slowly turning toward you, its eyes barely able to see in the dark cave.</p>
            <p>Your hands tremble as you bend over to pick up the cold rock from the caves floor. You only have one shot at this.</p>
            <p>You leap forward, adrenaline surging through your veins, ready to strike before it notices.</p>

        <div class="onSuccess">
            <h1> You Did It!</h1>
            <p>In one swift swing the monster is put to sleep. </p>
            <p>You continue on the path and finally see the sunlight in the distance.</p>
            <p>You made it! You are free!</p>
