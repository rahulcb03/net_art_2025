        <h1>You wake up in a dark cave...</h1>
        <p>Your head is pounding and as you wake up all you can hear is the steady drip of water echoing through the stone corridors.</p>
        <p>You try to remember how you got here, but your memory is a blur. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see two narrow passages ahead of you, one on the left and the other on the right.</p>
        <p>Which path will you take?</p>
