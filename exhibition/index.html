            <p>This exhibition highlights web-based artworks that rely on user interaction as a core element of the experience. These pieces showcase the internet as a space for play and exploration. Unlike traditional artwork displayed in museums, which is meant to be observed from a distance, net art transforms the audience into active participants within the work itself.</p>
            <p>This collection aims to explore this concept by gathering net art that challenges passive consumption by making interaction essential. Through playful mechanics, captivating animations, and immersive audio effects, these works demonstrate the internet's potential to serve as an evolving canvas for artists to share their creations. Each piece in this collection seeks to engage and interact with the viewer.</p>
