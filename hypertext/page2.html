    <h1> A Sudden Hole</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> As you start walking down the right path the rocks around start to rumble. You look foward and see a hole opening in the floor, blocking you from continuing on the path.</p>
    <p> You are now faced with two options. Either attempt to jump over or return to where you started</p>
    <div>
        <a href="index.html">Return to the start</a>

        <a href="page4.html">Jump over</a>
